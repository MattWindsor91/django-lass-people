==================
django-lass-people
==================

``django-lass-people`` is the membership database system for
*LASS*, the Django-based website system that powers the University
Radio York web presence.

It provides a few models and functions that allow *LASS* to access the
URY membership records and attach people to other items of data, for
example as content creators, approvers and credited people.

It was built mainly as a wrapper for the existing URY membership
database, with the hope of eventually generalising it.

Licence
=======

In short: 2-clause BSD or GPL version 2, take your pick.

``django-lass-people``, as a spin-off from the *LASS* project, is
licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.  However, as
it was comprised entirely of code solely written by URY and/or code
not under licence, the original author decided to dual-license under
GPLv2 and the FreeBSD 2-clause license.

Usage
=====

Documentation is coming soon (there are docstrings in the actual code,
but nothing much else).

Future changes
==============

Anything to generalise away from the URY membership database is
encouraged.
