django-lass-people
==================

*django-lass-people* provides the :mod:`people` package, which
describes a student radio station membership database and the means to
tag arbitrary models with people, either as lists of credits or as
in-line fields.

At time of writing :mod:`people` is woefully closely coupled to the
format of the URY membership database; this will hopefully change in
subsequent releases.
